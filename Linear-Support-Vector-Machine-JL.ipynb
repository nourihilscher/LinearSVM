    "We are trying to solve a problem of binary classification. Lets assume we are given a set $S$ of $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ datapoints $x_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ with corresponding labels $y_k \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$ (if the labels are given in the form $y_n \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ we suggest either transforming them or altering the algorithms given below). Our goal is to build and train a **Support Vector Machine** (SVM) which can be used to predict labels of new datapoints. In contrast to most other methods we will try to achive this by using linear optimzation (Simplex Algorithm).  \n",
